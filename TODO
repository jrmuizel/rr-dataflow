- Add an origin-follow command which will continuously do an origin until it gets to a place
  where it can't go any further
- Add an origin-revert command that takes you back to the place where you started the last
  origin-follow. It should be possible to implement this using gdb's checkpoint support.
- Switch to capstone 4. This will allow us to directly determine which registers are
  being read and written, which should improve the reliablity
- Port to C++ and include directly in RR. This should improve performance and should
  fix the missed write watchpoints for unchanged values problem.
